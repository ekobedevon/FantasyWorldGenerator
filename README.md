# Abnormal World Generator
## Intro
This project aims to simplify world building by handling the generation of the simple details in a world. Currently the program can only generate NPC's but, in the future, it will be able to generate entire settings with the click of a button. This is a ongoing project by Kobe Edmond and can be expected to get updates atleast once a month. Details on the tool can be found over in the [wiki](https://github.com/ekobedevon/FantasyWorldGenerator/wiki)

## Running the program
The program is compiled using [psgcompiler](https://pypi.org/project/psgcompiler/). You can either compile from the source code yourself, or alternatively you can get the latest version from this [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XVY92ZjCDrsCZ5TxiQvh2O8tXgkiBrbH?usp=sharing).

## Disclaimer
This program is designed to be a extremly useful ***tool*** that has a wide range of abilites to help you, but at the end it is only a ***tool***. This will not fully give you a publish ready world, but will instead give you the framework in order to build your own master piece on top of it. Of course as more features are added to the tool, the framework will be more and more complete, but it is safe to say it will never be able to add the spice of life that is human imagination that you, the user, provide. :)
