# FantasyWorldGenerator
##Intro
This project aims to simplify world building by handling the generation of the simple details in a world. Currently the program can only generate NPC's but, in the future, it will be able to generate entire settings with the click of a button. This is a ongoing project by Kobe Edmond and can be expected to get updates atleast once a month.

## Running the program
The program is compiled using [psgcompiler](https://pypi.org/project/psgcompiler/). You can either compile from the source code yourself, or alternatively you can get the latest version from this [drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5YE_RIYz1pnnxptLWZFDQUpeS81qLUC/view?usp=sharing).
