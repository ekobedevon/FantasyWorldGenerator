["People deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.",
"No one should get preferential treatment before the law, and no one is above the law.",
"Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress the people.",
"If I become strong, I can take what I want â€” what I deserve.",
"There's no good in pretending to be something I'm not.",
"Nothing and no one can steer me away from my higher calling."]
