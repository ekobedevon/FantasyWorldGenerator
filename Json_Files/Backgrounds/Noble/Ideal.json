["Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity.",
"It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine.",
"I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling of my family.",
"If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do.",
"Blood runs thicker than water.",
"It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me."]
